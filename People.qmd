# Principal Investigator

## Dr. Robert Schlauch

<img src="ROB.jpg" alt="Robert Sclauch" width="25%" align="left" />

My research interests focus broadly in understanding the role of individual differences in alcohol and drug use behavior. Specifically, I am interested in applying multidisciplinary approaches to the study of: **a)** processes associated with positive treatment outcomes, with a particular emphasis on craving and pretreatment change, **b)** risk factors for the development of substance use disorders (SUDs), including positive and negative reinforcement pathways to use, **c)** the interplay between substance use, comorbid disorders, personality, and aggression, including intimate partner violence, and **d)** the moderating role of individual difference variables in alcohol related disinhibited behaviors. Related to my work on craving, I am also interested (in collaboration with Dr. Diana Rancourt) in the applicability of craving as a transdiagnostic construct for disordered eating and compensatory behaviors. Secondary interests include methodological issues in clinical science broadly, and substance use research specifically.
